----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
	
Page 1. (Choice)

	On page one there is three selections:
		
		1. Player
			The player option is if you would like to play against another player on the same computer
			this is called Hot Seat play. By selecting this it will take you to the start page to continue.
		2. Computer
			The computer option will allow you to play against the computer as the computer will make 
			a call based off of the information that you have previously selected. By selecting this option
			you will be taken to the start page to continue
		3. Lan (check box/ This is not completely working)
			By selecting the Lan check box then selecting the player button you will be able to play against
			another player across the network. This is not working correctly and at this present time
			I have it only working on the local host machine. By selecting this option you will be taken
			to the Link page to continue.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Page 2. (Start)

	On page two there is a edit box to select the number of rounds you wish to play 
	by entering a number and then pressing the continue button you will be taken to the 
	draw page. You can also leave the edit box on 0 to play for a long time.
	
	You will also see that there is an update of you choices to see if you favour one more then the rest
	*please note this is what the computer will use*. 
	
	There is an back button to take you back to the choice page. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

page 3. (Draw)

	Three pictures and options will be available
	
	1. Rock				2. Paper			3. Scissor
	
	Now by selecting one of these it will be lock in as your choice and depending on if you are
	at the number of rounds you have selected or not it will take you to one of two options.
	
	1. Finish (Show)
		this will show who won the overall game
	2. continue (loading)
		this will show who won that round
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Page 4. (loading)

	this shows what you selected and what the other player (be it computer or person) has selected
	on top of this it shows you who won that round.
	
	You will see the options to continue which would take you back to the Draw page to choose again. 
	Alternatively there is a Finish button for you to end the game early which will take to the
	show page to show who won.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Page 5. (Show)

	This page just shows you who won the game and the only button on there will take you back to the
	Start page for you to be able to select if you want to play more rounds or go back to the Choice page.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Page 6. (Between play) (Player option only)

	This is just to allow time for the second player to be able to move in. One button to continue
	is all that there is on this page.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Page 7. (Link) (TCP/IP this is a trail and only works with local host)

	This first page is to allow you to enter an IP address of where you would to play 127.0.0.1 is the 
	local host. By selecting the Host option you will be player one. Pressing continue button to go to
	the next screen.

	So by opening two of this game on the same machine you will be able to point to the local address 
	for a proof of concept showing how it would work.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Page 8. (Waiting) (TCP/IP this is a trail and only works with local host)

	This is where you select to start/check the draw by selecting the button that the caption
	will change. When it says start you will get a pop up draw page to select what you want. When it
	says check it will check if other information has come in you can see the progress of this on the 
	number of players played number, when it reaches two then you can check and it will continue.
	By displaying the loading page you will only go to the show page when you selected exit.
